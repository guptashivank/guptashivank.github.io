We train and evaluate models using pixel-wise error metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE) and perceptual similarity (SSIM), and explore architectural improvements such as ResNet-based encoders and perceptual loss functions. Beyond quantitative benchmarks, we implement a pipeline for 3D reconstruction from predicted depth maps and camera poses, generating qualitative point cloud and mesh visualizations of gastrointestinal anatomy. This work highlights
key trade-offs between model complexity, generalization, and spatial reconstruction quality in medical vision tasks.
