**Goal.** Estimate depth from monocular laparoscopic video and reconstruct a consistent 3D scene representation.

**Approach.**
- 3-layer CNN with ResNet-18 backbone
- Depth prediction + qualitative validation via point clouds / reconstructions

**Results.**
- Reduced MSE to **0.0125**
- Increased SSIM to **0.8633**

**What I learned.**
- How to evaluate depth beyond a single metric (consistency, artifacts, failure cases)
- Practical tradeoffs in model capacity vs inference constraints
